# Welcome to React + Github API DEMO

Hi! 
  On this repository you're going to find a demo that i made with 'create-react-app' and Github API, it's very simple but with this small project i've leaned some core concepts about API's on React (I've used Bootstrap for stylization). 

# How it works?
Just type one Github username on the search bar and hit 'Search'. 
You can test it on [rodolfomoreira.dev](https://rodolfomoreira.dev/whoisgithub)
